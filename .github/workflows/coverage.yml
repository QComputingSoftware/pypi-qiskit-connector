name: Qiskit Connector Code Coverage Analysis
# This workflow generates a code coverage badge for the Qiskit Connector repository.
# It runs on every push and pull request to the main branch, ensuring that the badge is always up-to-date.
# The badge is generated using the emibcn/badge-action and is committed to the main branch.
# The badge is then synced to the stable branch, ensuring that both branches have the latest coverage information.
