## Sample Workflow

```python
from qiskit_connector import QConnectorV2 as connector
from qiskit_connector import QPlanV2 as plan
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import SamplerV2 as Sampler, Session

# Initialize connector and plan
current = plan()
backend = connector()

# Define entangled base circuit with superposition and CNOT entanglement
def base_circuit():
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    for q in range(2):
        qc.h(q)
        qc.rx(0.5, q)
        qc.rz(1.0, q)
        qc.s(q)
        qc.t(q)
        qc.h(q)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])
    return qc

# Create randomized circuits with depolarizing noise model
def randomize_circuit(base_qc, p):
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    # Apply randomized Pauli gates before and after the base circuit
    # ... [pauli gate application code here] ...
    return qc

# Prepare circuits
rand_range = 5
p = 0.1
qc = base_circuit()
circuits = [randomize_circuit(qc, p) for _ in range(rand_range)]

# Transpile and submit jobs
qc_t = [transpile(c, backend=backend, optimization_level=3) for c in circuits[:rand_range]]
if current == "Open Plan":
    sampler = Sampler(mode=backend)
    job = sampler.run(qc_t, shots=1)
elif current == "Paid Plan":
    with Session(backend=backend.name) as session:
        sampler = Sampler(mode=session)
        job = sampler.run(qc_t, shots=1)

# Monitor job and retrieve results, then display histograms
# ...
